# Namesearch.io Development Scratchpad

*Last updated: 2025-06-03 22:38 PM*

## 🔄 System Recovery & Current Status (2025-06-03 22:16)

*This section was added by Cascade after a system restart to re-establish context.*

**Git Status:**
*   Currently on branch `feature/phase1-foundation`.
*   Branch is up to date with `origin/feature/phase1-foundation`.
*   Numerous files are modified across both `backend` and `frontend`, particularly related to search functionalities and authentication. This suggests active development was underway.
*   Untracked files of potential interest: `GOALS.md`, `troubleshooting_log.md`.

**Project Overview:**
*   **Project:** `Namesearch.io` - AI-powered brand and domain name intelligence platform.
*   **Tech Stack:** FastAPI (Python) backend, React/TypeScript/Vite frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker.

**Development Progress (as per last scratchpad update & file review):**
*   **Current Phase:** Phase 1: Core Search Enhancement.
*   **Stated Current Sprint Focus:** "Phase 1 - Core Search Enhancement"
*   **Tasks Marked "In Progress" (and likely related to modified files):**
    *   `[ ] Implement price range filtering`
    *   `[ ] Add domain length filters`
    *   `[ ] Create advanced search panel component`
    *   `[ ] Update search API to handle new filters`
*   **Recently Completed (before "In Progress" items):** Basic domain search, TLD selection, basic search history.
*   **Next Up (after current "In Progress" items):** Sorting functionality, bulk domain search, save search, export functionality.

*Proceeding in Planner mode as requested.*

**Review of Untracked Files (`GOALS.md`, `troubleshooting_log.md`):**
*   `GOALS.md` (undated, but context suggests early June 2nd):
    *   Marked "Fix domain extension selection UI/UX" as complete.
    *   Session objectives included fixing domain extension selection, ensuring frontend-backend communication, and setting up monitoring/logging.
*   `troubleshooting_log.md` (last entry 2025-06-02 01:53 AM):
    *   Details fixes for "Frontend Initialization," "Domain Extension Selection," and "Backend Connection."
    *   Indicated "Current Focus" at that time was testing a new `build_monitor.py` script and verifying recent fixes.
*   **Note on Context:** These files reflect work and priorities from early June 2nd. The `scratchpad.md` (last updated June 2nd, 15:12 PM) and the current `git status` (showing modifications to search and auth features) suggest that development subsequently moved on to the "Phase 1: Core Search Enhancement" tasks.

**Reconfirmed Current Focus:**
Based on the `scratchpad.md`'s "Current Sprint" and "Tasks in Progress" sections, corroborated by the extensive file modifications shown in `git status`, the primary active development area before the interruption was likely the **Phase 1: Core Search Enhancement** tasks:
*   `[ ] Implement price range filtering`
*   `[ ] Add domain length filters`
*   `[ ] Create advanced search panel component`
*   `[ ] Update search API to handle new filters`


## 🎯 Current Focus

## 🚀 Domain Search Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Search Enhancement (Week 1-2)

#### Planner Session Update (2025-06-03)

**Background and Motivation:**
The user wants to prioritize making the general domain search (with existing price/length filters) and a new WHOIS lookup feature functional. This session focuses on breaking these down into actionable, UI-first tasks.

**Key Challenges and Analysis:**
- **Domain Search Backend:** Requires implementing a robust API that can handle various filters and efficiently query the domain data source.
- **WHOIS Service:** Choosing a reliable WHOIS lookup method (library or external API) and parsing inconsistent WHOIS data formats can be challenging.
- **Frontend Integration:** Ensuring smooth user experience with loading states, error handling, and clear presentation of results for both features.
- **Project Configuration:** Ongoing TypeScript linting issues in the frontend project need to be addressed separately to ensure code quality and catch potential errors early, though they don't block the functional implementation of these features directly.

#### Detailed Plan: WHOIS Search Functionality

**1. Frontend - UI for Single Domain WHOIS Lookup**
- Status: `[ ] To Do`
- Branch Name: `feature/phase1-whois-ui` (suggested)
- Sub-tasks:
  - `[ ] Design UI Elements`: Input field for domain name, "Lookup WHOIS" button, area for results/errors. Define placement (e.g., main search page, dedicated tool section).
    - Success Criteria: UI design/mockup approved or clear requirements documented.
  - `[ ] Implement UI Elements in React Component`: Create or update component, manage state for input domain and WHOIS results.
    - Success Criteria: UI elements rendered and interactive.
- Executor's Feedback: 
- Lessons Learned: 

**2. Backend - Core WHOIS Service & API Endpoint**
- Status: `[ ] To Do`
- Branch Name: `feature/phase1-whois-api` (suggested)
- Sub-tasks:
  - `[ ] Research/Select WHOIS Library/Method`: Choose Python WHOIS library (e.g., `python-whois`) or external API. Consider rate limits, reliability.
    - Success Criteria: Method for WHOIS lookup selected and documented.
  - `[ ] Implement Core WHOIS Lookup Service`: Function to perform lookup, parse relevant info (registrar, dates, nameservers), handle errors (domain not found, lookup fail).
    - Success Criteria: Service function retrieves and parses WHOIS data for test domains.
  - `[ ] Implement FastAPI Endpoint for WHOIS`: Endpoint e.g., `GET /api/v1/whois/{domain_name}`. Define request/response (structured WHOIS data or error) with Pydantic models.
    - Success Criteria: API endpoint accessible and returns WHOIS data as per contract.
  - `[ ] Write Unit/Integration Tests`: Test core service and API endpoint.
    - Success Criteria: Basic WHOIS functionality covered by tests.
- Executor's Feedback: 
- Lessons Learned: 

**3. Frontend - Integrate WHOIS UI with Backend API**
- Status: `[ ] To Do` (Depends on WHOIS UI & API tasks)
- Branch Name: `feature/phase1-whois-ui` or `feature/phase1-whois-integration` (suggested)
- Sub-tasks:
  - `[ ] Create Frontend API Service Function for WHOIS`: Call backend WHOIS API.
    - Success Criteria: Service function can fetch WHOIS data from (mocked or real) backend.
  - `[ ] Connect UI to Service Function`: On button click, call service with input domain. Manage loading/error states.
    - Success Criteria: UI triggers API call correctly.
  - `[ ] Display WHOIS Results`: Render fetched WHOIS data or errors in UI. Format for readability.
    - Success Criteria: User sees WHOIS information or errors clearly displayed.
