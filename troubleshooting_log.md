# Troubleshooting Log

## 2025-06-02 01:53 AM - Initial Setup
- Created GOALS.md and troubleshooting_log.md
- Setting up build monitoring script

## Issues Encountered
1. **Frontend Initialization**
   - Issue: Blank white page on load
   - Identified Problems:
     - Missing public/index.html file
     - Missing root div in HTML
     - Missing Tailwind CSS configuration
     - Missing proper entry point setup
   - Status: Fixed - Added missing files and configurations

2. **Domain Extension Selection**
   - Issue: Domain extensions not toggling correctly
   - Fixes:
     - Removed automatic default selection when all TLDs are deselected
     - Updated Clear button to reset to empty selection
     - Simplified Select All functionality
     - Removed unnecessary dependencies from callbacks
   - Status: Fixed and ready for testing
   - Testing Notes:
     - Should be able to select/deselect any TLD
     - Clear button should reset selection to empty
     - Select All should select all available TLDs
     - UI should update immediately on selection changes
     - No automatic default selection when all are deselected

3. **Backend Connection**
   - Issue: Frontend couldn't connect to backend
   - Identified: Port mismatch (frontend was using 8000, backend on 5003)
   - Fixed: Updated frontend .env to use port 5003
   - Status: Fixed

4. **Build Monitoring**
   - Need to implement build monitoring script
   - Will create a Python script to monitor build processes

## Current Focus
- Testing build monitoring script
- Verifying domain extension functionality
- Testing frontend-backend communication

## Progress
- Created build_monitor.py script with:
  - Real-time status monitoring
  - Log tracking
  - Graceful error handling
  - CLI interface
  - Configurable check intervals

## Next Steps
- Test the build monitoring script
- Integrate with actual build system
- Add more detailed error handling
- Consider adding notifications for build completion
